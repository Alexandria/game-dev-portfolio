## Overview

In this Unity project, I lead the core game development of the project as well
as the project management. Including myself, our team of 5 was consisted of a
composer, level designer, QA tester, game artist, and game developer. This was
an "endless runner" type of game where the player must escape the lair of the
evil Candy hag. There is 3 total levels and unique music for each level.

## Key Features

- **Player Momentum Mechanic**: Over time if the player continues to
  successfully dodge the enemies they will gain a larger distance from the Candy
  Hag.
- **Knock Back Mechanic**: If the player fails to dodge a candy minion then they
  are pushed back closer to the hag. If the hag catches up to the player then
  she turns them into on of her candy minions and it's game over.
- **Candy Hag Special Attack**: In the final level Candy Hag has a special
  attack where she summons minions from her want. The player would then need to
  doge the minions in from of them as well as the spells coming from behind.
- **Custom Music**: Each scene and level in the game has a custom music.
  Additionally, as the player progresses through each level the music motif
  changes to become more epic.
- **Custom Character Art and Backgrounds**: All character and environment art
  was custom made for this game. Additionally, the themed story book UI asstes
  where also custom made.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For Building out the core features of the game.
- **Fig Jam**: Brain Storming on prototyping with the team.
- **Google Drive**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **Trello Board**: For sprint planning and tracking tasks.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was integrating all of the team member's
contributions seamlessly into the project. This was the first Unity game project
for many of us so understanding certain aspects of the engine like the Canvas
UI, Animation player, and component system was a bit of a learning curve. We
were also all working remotely so we had to depend on a bunch of other tools to
better community and track our progress.

## Outcome

After publishing the final game on Itch.io we sent out a survey and got a lot of
great feedback on the game. Amazingly, no critical bugs were reported. While the
general consensus was that the game was a little too easy, overall the players
enjoyed the art, music, and controls. Even more encouraging, several players
voiced they would love to see this game expanded.

Below are some feedback from players:

> "The music was FANTASTIC! The controls were smooth and the graphics were
> freaking adorable."

> "I wish the levels would've been a little longer and that as you progressed
> down the level things had to move a little faster. It felt a bit slow but
> honestly I can see the potential of it."

> "Great work on this game! It feels very polished and the idea is solid. Can't
> wait to see what comes next from your studio"
